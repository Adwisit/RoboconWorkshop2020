To active the virtual enviroment you have to run one of these commands from the root of the repo.

Run this one if you are using cmd:
```
.\Python_Enviroment\Scripts\activate.bat
```

This on in Powershell:
```
.\Python_Enviroment\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If none of them would work you can install all the packages directly with this command (also run from the root of the repo):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

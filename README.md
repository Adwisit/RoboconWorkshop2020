## Download

If you are unfamiliar with git, I recommend you yo to download this repository as a zip file. Just click on the green *Clone or download* button and select *Download ZIP*.

## Installation Package

We have included a installation file for the libraries that we suggest that you use (you are more than welcome to use other libraries to solve the task).

To install the package in your current python enviroment, all you need to do is to run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

from inside the repository folder.

If you don't want to install the package in your current python enviroment you can follow the instructions down below on how to set up a virtual enviroment.

### Windows



### Mac and Linux

---

To active the virtual enviroment you have to run one of these commands from the root of the repo.

Run this one if you are using cmd:
```
.\Python_Enviroment\Scripts\activate.bat
```

This on in Powershell:
```
.\Python_Enviroment\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If none of them would work you can install all the packages directly with this command (also run from the root of the repo):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
